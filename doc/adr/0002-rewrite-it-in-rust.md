# 2. Rewrite it in Rust

Date: 2024-03-04

## Status

Accepted

## Context

There are a bunch of rewrites already. Some of them look to be incomplete and/or abandoned. This implementation should be at least both 
feature equivalent to the current tools, compatible (or optionally compatible for backwards, uh, compatibility), and extensible with
new features that make the tool even more useful.

## Decision

Rewrite the original `adr-tools` in Rust.

## Consequences

A blazingly fast Architectural Decision Record command line tool for the entire world to enjoy.
